            <b>Godot</b> is a free Open Source 2D and 3D game engine. It has a fast growing community with addons <br>
            coming out constantly. This page will focus on making a new project and learing the layout <br>
            for the engine. <br>
            <br><i><b>Downloading Godot</b></i> <br>
            You can download Godot 4.2 at godotengine.org. The engine supports <br>
            Windows, macOS, and Linux. <br>
            <br><i><b>How to Create a project</b></i> <br>
            Once you've opened up Godot you should see this screen here: <br>
            <br> <img src="tutImage1.png" alt="godot screen" width="800"> <br>
            <br> Click on new project and this screen should pop up: <br>
            <br> <img src="tutImage2.png" alt="godot screen" width="625">
            <br> Once you see this you may be confused. The top part is naming your project, you can title it anything. <br>
            Below is the project path. Click on create folder to create a folder that will store all of your game files. <br>
            Under that is the rendering option. Rendering is the computer drawing the frames of your project. Forward+ is <br>
            what you would probably use. It is made for PC games which most people are using. Mobile is for mobile devices <br>
            which will have lower end lighting and resolution. Cambatability will have very low graphics and resolution and <br>
            is made for very low end devices. <br>
            <br><i><b>Intro to the Godot layout</b></i> <br>
            You have now created your project. You are now inside of the Godot Enine. Your screen should look like this: <br>
            <br> <img src="tutImage3.png" alt="godot screen" width="1000"> <br>
            <br> Once you see this screen you will first notice the center which is the scene. The scene is where all of <br>
            your objects are displayed. This is your game world. Your levels your characters and other stuff are displayed there. to the left <br>
            is your object tree. The object tree is where all of your objects are, like platforms, characters, enemies, ect. <br>
            You can select an object from the object tree and change its position and size and other properties. <br>
            right below the object tree is the file system. This is your game files like scripts, images, textures, 3D models ect. <br>
            to the right of that is the console. This will tell you if there are errors and also helps with debugging. <br>
            To the right of the screen is the inspector. This will display all of a objects properties. (Scale, position, textures, and more) <br>
            <br> That is pretty much the basics of Godot's layout but there is alot more that is impossible to fit in one web page. If you want to <br>
